# data-backup
Points: 250
The backup of our data was somehow corrupted. Recover the data and be rewarded with a flag.

## Solving
My first attempt is to restore the file from the backup with `foremost` or `binwalk -e`. So I tried it with `binwalk` and got some files. Also a PDF file, that contains the flag.
