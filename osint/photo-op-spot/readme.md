In three words tell me where I stood when I grabbed this [picture](photo-op-spot.JPG).

## Solving
Okay we got a picture from a strange tower... lets google for that picture. We'll find quickly what we are looking for.. the tower is located in Seattle.

```
Public Art "Transforest"
Tourist attraction in Seattle, Washington
```

Now we have to find the *three words*, therefore we use the website [what3words.com](https://what3words.com/).

The three words can be different, cause of the cords. My words are:
> wipes.milk.shower
